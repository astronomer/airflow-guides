This guide describes the prerequisite steps to install Astronomer on Amazon Web Services (AWS).  

## Are you admin-y enough to do this alone?

You will need to be able to:

* Obtain a wildcard SSL certificate
* Edit your DNS records
* Create resources on AWS
* Install/run Kubernetes command line tools to your machine

## Pre-requisites

Before running the Astronomer install command you must:

1. [Select a base domain](/guides/install-base-domain)
1. [Get your machine setup with needed dev tools](/guides/install-dev-env)
1. [Get a Postgres server running](/guides/install-postgres)
1. [Obtain SSL](/guides/install-ssl)
1. [Set a few Kubernetes secrets](/guides/install-k8s-secrets)
1. [Create Google OAuth Creds ](/guides/install-google-oauth)
1. [Build your config.yaml](/guides/install-config)
1. [Create a stateful storage set](/guides/install-aws-stateful-set)

## Install Astronomer

You're ready to go!

```shell
$ helm install -f config.yaml . --namespace astronomer
```
## DNS routing

Your final step is to setup your DNS to route traffic to your airflow resources following [these steps](/guides/install-aws-dns).

Click the link in the output notes to log in to the Astronomer app.

<!-- ## Troubleshooting
